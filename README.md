  <strong>A open community for people
  </strong>
</div>

Welcome to the [Forem](https://forem.com) codebase, the platform that powers
[dev.to](https://dev.to). We are so excited to have you. With your help, we can
build out Forem’s usability, scalability, and stability to better serve our
communities.

## What is Forem?

Forem is open source software for building communities. Communities for your
peers, customers, fanbases, families, friends, and any other time and space
where people need to come together to be part of a collective.
[See our announcement post](https://dev.to/devteam/for-empowering-community-2k6h)
for a higher level overview of what Forem is.

[dev.to](https://dev.to) (or just DEV) is hosted by Forem. It is a community of
software developers who write articles, take part in discussions, and build
their professional profiles. We value supportive and constructive dialogue in
the pursuit of great code and career growth for all members. The ecosystem spans
from beginner to advanced developers, and all are welcome to find their place
within our community. ❤️
